Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud?resource=download

Note: The data was downloaded from the data source and then uploaded to Google Drive

It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation.

Due to confidentiality issues, there are not provided the original features and more background information about the data.

Features V1, V2, ... V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA;

The only features which have not been transformed with PCA are Time and Amount. Feature Time contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.

The feature Amount is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-senstive learning.

Feature Class is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.
